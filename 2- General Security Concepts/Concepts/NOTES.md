are lists of rules that define permissions for accessing system resources, controlling who can do what with files, directories, or network traffic, acting like digital bouncers by permitting or denying actions (read, write, execute, etc.) based on specified criteria like user identity or IP address, crucial for security and resource management in operating systems and networks.
# Domain Controller
A Domain Controller (DC) is a server that acts as the central gatekeeper for a computer network, managing user authentication, authorization, and security policies for a domain, typically using Active Directory (AD). It verifies users' login credentials, ensures they have permission to access specific resources (like files, printers, applications), and centrally manages user accounts, devices, and security rules, providing a secure and efficient way to administer a network

# Active directory
Microsoft's centralized directory service for Windows domain networks, acting as a "phone book" for IT infrastructure that manages users, computers, resources, and security by handling **[authentication](https://www.google.com/search?client=ubuntu-sn&channel=fs&q=authentication&ved=2ahUKEwik4ZPCzouSAxVhU6QEHbpoGKAQgK4QegYIAAgAEAQ)** (verifying identities) and **[authorization](https://www.google.com/search?client=ubuntu-sn&channel=fs&q=authorization&ved=2ahUKEwik4ZPCzouSAxVhU6QEHbpoGKAQgK4QegYIAAgAEAU)** (controlling access). It provides a hierarchical structure for organizing network elements, allowing administrators to manage permissions and apply policies (Group Policy) across the entire network from a central point, simplifying management and enhancing security.
