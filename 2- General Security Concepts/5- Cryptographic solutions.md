# Hashing
In cybersecurity, **hash functions** are foundational tools used to ensure **data integrity** and protect **passwords**. A hash transforms any input — a sentence, a file, or even an entire hard drive — into a **fixed-length string of characters** called a **hash value** or **digest**.

But here’s the catch:  
Hashing is **one-way**.  
You can convert data _into_ a hash, but you cannot reverse the process to recover the original input.

ashing relies on specific cryptographic properties:

| **Property**             | **Description**                                                                      |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Fixed Output Length**  | No matter how large or small the input is, the hash has a consistent length.         |
| **One-Way Function**     | You cannot reverse a hash to retrieve the original data.                             |
| **Collision Resistance** | It is extremely unlikely that two different inputs will produce the same hash value. |
| **Deterministic**        | The same input always generates the same hash value (if using the same algorithm).   |
Popular hashing algorithms include:

|               |                 |                                                                           |
| ------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Algorithm** | **Digest Size** | **Notes**                                                                 |
| **MD5**       | 128 bits        | Fast but no longer considered secure; may still be used for compatibility |
| **SHA-1**     | 160 bits        | Also broken; not recommended                                              |
| **SHA-256**   | 256 bits        | Secure and widely used today (part of the SHA-2 family)                   |
### **Real-World Uses**
1. Verifying File Integrity
2. Password Storage
### Salting
While hashing helps secure passwords, it’s still vulnerable to **rainbow table attacks** (precomputed hash lookup attacks). That’s where **salting** comes in.
**Salting** is the process of adding a **random string** (called a salt) to a password **before** hashing it.
This makes every password hash **unique**, even if two users choose the same password.

**Example:**
- Password: Gomycode123
- Salt: 8rTz!xQ4
- Combined: Gomycode1238rTz!xQ4 → then hashed

Even if hackers know the hash of Gomycode123, the added salt ensures it won’t match unless the salt is also known.
### **HMAC (Hash-Based Message Authentication Code)**
While hashing ensures **integrity**, it doesn’t verify **authenticity** — that’s where **HMAC** comes in. An **HMAC** is a special type of hash that uses **a secret key along with the data**. It ensures:
- The data has **not been modifie**
- The data came from a **trusted source**

**Common use cases**: API authentication, TLS handshakes, digital signatures.
### **Key Stretching**
While salting protects passwords from rainbow table attacks, **key stretching** is used to make brute-force and dictionary attacks **computationally expensive**.
Key stretching transforms a short, possibly weak password into a **stronger cryptographic key** by **repeating hashing operations thousands of times**. This makes it take significantly longer for an attacker to guess a password — even with powerful hardware.
#### **Techniques for Key Stretching**
- **PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2)**  
    Applies a hash function thousands of times with a salt. Commonly used in secure password storage and encryption key generation.
- **Bcrypt**  
    Specifically built for password hashing. It adds salting and automatically increases its workload over time (configurable with a "cost" factor).
